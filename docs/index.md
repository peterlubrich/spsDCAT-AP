## Welcome to spsDCAT-AP


This project is about a draft Metadata specification to describe data and information offered by Smart Parking Systems (SPS). It particular, it is elaborated as an extension to the DCAT-AP Metadata specification. The working title for such an extension is “spsDCAT-AP” (DCAT-AP extension for Metadata for Smart Parking Systems ).

This work has been produced in the context of a research paper: "A Metadata Model to describe Data and Information of Smart Parking Systems" Peter Lubrich, Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt), Germany (to be published during 2020)

Abstract from this paper:

Smart Parking Systems (SPS) represent an evolving and heterogeneous field of approaches and applications in parking management. One commonality is that all present systems deal with digital data related to the parking domain, such as data about parking infrastructure, parking demand, transactions and similar. One way to capture and categorise the data of SPS in a comprehensive and comparable manner is to look on metadata, i.e. structured descriptions about the data of SPS. This paper presents an approach to model metadata in the field of SPS. This metadata model intends to systematically describe the data offerings of such systems, e.g. their contents, coverage and technical representation. This work aims to set a baseline to improving the interoperability between actors in Parking Space Management, which currently rather rely on isolated data environments. A metadata model, enabling a common description of data offerings of individual SPS, may eventually foster an integrated ecosystem of data exchange in the parking sector. The model is built upon established frameworks for describing metadata, namely the Resource Description Framework (RDF). For reasons of re-usability and interoperability, it is also adopting metadata vocabularies from the domains of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and governmental data catalogues. Such a modelling has not been initiated for the domain of parking data, as the author can see.
